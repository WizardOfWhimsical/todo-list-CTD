# Todo List App – Week 1

This is a simple Todo List web app built as part of my Code the Dream (CTD) React course, **Week 1**. The goal of this assignment was to set up a new React project using Vite, get familiar with version control (Git + GitHub), and render a dynamic list of todos in the browser.

---

## 📝 App Overview

- **Name:** Todo List
- **Description:**  
  A basic React app that displays a title and a list of todo items. It’s designed as a starting point for learning React, project scaffolding, and best practices around code style (ESLint, Prettier).

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   cd todo-list
   ```
   Install Dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. 🏃 Running the Development Server

   Start the local dev server with:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and go to the Local URL displayed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

   You should see the Todo List title and three sample todos.

3. 🛠️ Technologies Used

   Vite – for fast project setup and development server

   React (JSX) – building the UI

   JavaScript – app logic

   ESLint & Prettier – code quality and formatting (see Stretch Goals)

4. 📚 Stretch Goals (Optional)
   - ESLint:
     Added React linting to help catch code errors and enforce style.

   - Prettier:
     Integrated Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Both tools can be installed as VS Code extensions and with npm install as described in project instructions.

### 💡 What I Learned / Reflections – Week 1

#### This week, I worked closely with my mentor EJ. Here are some of the key things I learned, tripped over, or just found cool:

- Config Files Matter:
  I got my first real exposure to customizing config files—like ESLint and Prettier. It’s cool to see how these can enforce clean code and help catch mistakes before they get big.

- Branching & Repo Management:
  I made a common mistake—getting so excited I jumped into making a branch before pushing my “main” branch to GitHub. I learned how to reset things and manage my branches/commits properly, with EJ’s help. Turns out, knowing how to do a hard reset and reference commit IDs is invaluable!

- Talking Through Problems:
  Walking my mentor through my process—explaining how and why I did things—helped me lock down my own understanding. It felt good to be able to teach back what I learned.

- Mapping in React:
  Mapping an array to create dynamic UI (the todo list) felt straightforward, but it’s powerful. React’s way of turning data into DOM is starting to make sense!

- It’s Okay to Ask for Help:
  Having a mentor there when I got stuck made a huge difference. I’m getting better at knowing what I don’t know and reaching out for help early.

### 🏁 Next Steps

1. Continue to add new features and learn more React concepts

2. Practice better git habits from the start (branching, commit discipline)

3. Dive deeper into JSX and component structure

**Note :**
This project is a school assignment. Any code not written by me is clearly marked as "AI-assisted" or from my mentor.
