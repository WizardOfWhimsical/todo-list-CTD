# Todo List App – Week 1

This is a simple Todo List web app built as part of my Code the Dream (CTD) React course, **Week 1**. The goal of this assignment was to set up a new React project using Vite, get familiar with version control (Git + GitHub), and render a dynamic list of todos in the browser.

---

## 📝 App Overview

- **Name:** Todo List
- **Description:**  
  A basic React app that displays a title and a list of todo items. It’s designed as a starting point for learning React, project scaffolding, and best practices around code style (ESLint, Prettier).

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   cd todo-list
   ```
   Install Dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. **🏃 Running the Development Server**

   Start the local dev server with:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and go to the Local URL displayed in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

   You should see the Todo List title and three sample todos.

3. **🛠️ Technologies Used**
   - **Vite** – for fast project setup and development server
   - **React** (JSX) – building the UI
   - **JavaScript** – app logic
   - **ESLint & Prettier** – code quality and formatting (see Stretch Goals)

4. **📚 Stretch Goals (Optional)**
   - **ESLint:**
     Added React linting to help catch code errors and enforce style.

   - **Prettier:**
     Integrated Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Both tools can be installed as VS Code extensions and with npm install as described in project instructions.

### 💡 What I Learned / Reflections – Week 1

---

#### This week, I worked closely with my mentor EJ. Here are some of the key things I learned, tripped over, or just found cool:

- Config Files Matter:
  I got my first real exposure to customizing config files—like ESLint and Prettier. It’s cool to see how these can enforce clean code and help catch mistakes before they get big.

- Branching & Repo Management:
  I made a common mistake—getting so excited I jumped into making a branch before pushing my “main” branch to GitHub. I learned how to reset things and manage my branches/commits properly, with EJ’s help. Turns out, knowing how to do a hard reset and reference commit IDs is invaluable!

- Talking Through Problems:
  Walking my mentor through my process—explaining how and why I did things—helped me lock down my own understanding. It felt good to be able to teach back what I learned.

- Mapping in React:
  Mapping an array to create dynamic UI (the todo list) felt straightforward, but it’s powerful. React’s way of turning data into DOM is starting to make sense!

- It’s Okay to Ask for Help:
  Having a mentor there when I got stuck made a huge difference. I’m getting better at knowing what I don’t know and reaching out for help early.

### 🏁 Next Steps

1. Continue to add new features and learn more React concepts

2. Practice better git habits from the start (branching, commit discipline)

3. Dive deeper into JSX and component structure

This project is built primarily as a **learning exercise** following the [Web Dev Simplified “Learning React” Todo List Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8). Most concepts, code structure, and logic are based on that video and its accompanying resources.

- **AI Usage:**  
  No code in this project was generated by AI (ChatGPT/Echo) up to this point; however, AI has been used for rubber-duck debugging, explaining concepts, and project planning/discussion only.  
  If/when any code is suggested or generated by AI, it will be clearly marked as “AI-assisted” within code comments, in accordance with course guidelines.

# 🚀 React Pilot Learning Log – _Adding, Updating, and Mapping Inventory Lesson 4_

---

## 1️⃣ Counter Milestone

- 🧮 Started by building a **counter** using React’s `useState` hook.
- Learned how to update state both by setting a direct value and by passing a function (e.g., `setCount(prev => prev + 3)`).
- Realized that passing a function to a state setter lets you _safely_ use the previous value, especially for rapid updates or asynchronous behavior.

---

## 2️⃣ Importing Data & useState Setup

- 🗂️ Created a `data.json` file to store starter inventory items.
- Imported this data and used it to **initialize** the inventory state in the main `App` component:
  - `const [inventory, setInventory] = useState(inventoryData.inventory)`
- 🔎 Learned: The initial state can be anything—array, object, number, etc.—but useState itself always returns a `[value, setValue]` array.

---

## 3️⃣ Managing State & Adding Items

- 📝 Built a **form** to accept new item details (name and description).
- Used controlled components: `value` bound to state, `onChange` handlers to update state on every keystroke.
- 🏷️ Used `window.crypto.randomUUID()` to generate unique IDs for new items (for React keys & data integrity).
- ✋ Used `e.preventDefault()` in the form’s submit handler to stop the page from reloading.
- 🚫 Remembered: **Never mutate state directly** (no `.push()`); always return a new array/object (`return [...prev, newItem]`).
- 🛠️ Each form submission creates a new item object and updates the inventory array by appending it (immutably).

---

## 4️⃣ Rendering & Mapping

- 🔄 Used `.map()` to render each item in the inventory as a list item (`<li>`), with proper keys for React’s rendering.
- 💡 Noticed: Any time `setInventory` runs, it causes a re-render, displaying the latest items _instantly_.

---

## 5️⃣ Mentor Wisdom & Next Steps

- 🧑‍🏫 **EJ’s Guidance:** React is powerful for complex, dynamic data—but not every site needs it.  
  Sometimes, plain HTML/CSS is simpler, faster, and more resilient (especially if JS breaks).
- 🏆 Takeaways:
  - Don’t overcomplicate for simple sites.
  - Use React for real-time data, forms, lists, and stateful UIs.
  - _Efficiency and robustness win interviews and jobs, not just trendy tech._

- 📋 **Assignment/Challenge:**
  - Abstract the unordered list and list item into a separate component, pass the data as props, and keep state updates immutable.
  - Practice thinking in _components_—find ways to split code into reusable chunks.

---

## 🎉 Happy Notes

- _Breakthrough Moment:_ Understanding why functions get passed to state setters, and how “previous value” works in React.
- _Feeling_: It was a marathon, but the struggle is how you build real skill—today, things finally started to click.

🗣️ **Reflection:**

> “The work will teach you. The more you explain, the more it sticks.”  
> This README log will help future-me remember how I made it all click, piece by piece.

---

> **Transparency Statement**
> To the best of my knowledge, GitHub Copilot has been turned off during this project.  
> Any small suggestion boxes that appear while typing are standard editor autocomplete or IntelliSense features.
> I use **ChatGPT** regularly to help me **understand difficult concepts**, talk through assignments, and organize my thoughts — much like studying with a tutor or mentor.  
> Echo also helps me write and format my **README files**, but **all code in this project is hand‑typed by me.**
> If there are any questions about how something was written, please ask me to explain my code — I’d be happy to walk through it.
